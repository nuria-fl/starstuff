#StarStuff

>“The nitrogen in our DNA, the calcium in our teeth, the iron in our blood, the carbon in our apple pies were made in the interiors of collapsing stars. We are made of starstuff.” 

StarStuff helps you keep up to date with all things space related. Keep track of the next meteor shower, moon eclipse or passing comet. Look at how others have seen the events and share your own photographs.

What this app will do:

###Stage 1

    + Visibility:
        * Naked eye
        * Binoculars
        * Telescope
